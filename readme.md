# OktaDev Content Reminder

> Note: This code is running at [pipedream](https://pipedream.com)

This script connects to the OktaDev LeanKit board and scans for cards in the "In Progress" lane that haven't been updated in more than seven (7) days. When it finds a that has been inactive, it adds a comment to the card @-mentioning the assigned user(s) asking for an update on progress.
